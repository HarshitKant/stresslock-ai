# 🌿 StressLock AI  
> When your laptop cares more about your mental health than you do.

## 🧠 What It Does
**StressLock AI** uses your webcam to monitor facial expressions and posture.  
If you look stressed for too long, it literally **locks your laptop** and tells you to *go touch grass*.  
Because sometimes you won’t listen to yourself, but you *will* listen to Python.
